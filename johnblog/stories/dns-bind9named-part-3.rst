Right now we have a really nice configuration of bind9. But we have no log about queries and actions. So what we're going to do now is to log in a file different queries and actions. To do we gonna add some lines in named.conf.local (or in options, if you prefer).

.. code::

   logging {
   channel query.log
   {
	file "/var/log/bind/query.log";
	//Set the severity to dynamic to see all the debug messages.
	severity debug 3;
   };
	category default { default_syslog; default_debug; };
	category unmatched { null; };
	category queries { query.log; };
   };
