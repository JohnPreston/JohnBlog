<p>Eucalyptus is an open source software to have your own Cloud Computing platform. In these parts, we will see each part of this really powerful service, to understand how it works, some best practices, and I will try to give you my best tips for a daily usage.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestion, correction or if you want to have more help, I do invite you to join us on our IRC Channel (irc.freenode.net -&gt; #eucalyptus)</p>
